/**
 * Provides a specialized interface for building the query that will be used to
 * fetch the adaptive media images. This builder allows to specify the
 * requirements that should be met by the adaptive media images using the
 * methods available.
 *
 * The recommended use of this interface is by chaining those methods to create
 * the query with the requirements. These methods can either be:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Initial: they need to be invoked as the first method in the chain. They can
 * be chained by other methods to add more requirements.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Intermediate: they can be chained to an initial method or to another
 * intermediate method to add more requirements.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Terminal: they can be chained bo both initial or intermediate methods but
 * they don't accept any more chaining.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
